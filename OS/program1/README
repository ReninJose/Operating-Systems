This assignment uses a "Make" file to build the following codes. Typing just "make" in the shell compiles and execute the code at the same time.
If editing "test.txt" is desired, run "make clean" in the shell to clean up previous compilation. This will make room for new executable with new "test.txt".
Edit "test.txt", and rerun the program by typing "make".
