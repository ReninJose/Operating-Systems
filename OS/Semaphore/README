EECE.4811 Operating Systems

This folder consist of 3 c++ programs (barrier.cpp, rendezvous.cpp, and fork-join.cpp) performing semaphore operations. The names of the files are self-explanatory.

The following commands are available for user to run the programs using the makfile.

"make build" - Compiles all the C++ code into respective executable files.

"make fork_" - Runs the fork-join.cpp program

"make rendezvous_" - Runs the rendezvous.cpp program

"make barrier_ NUM_OF_THREADS=<integer>" - Runs the barrier.cpp program. Takes in a command line argument that specifies the number of threads needed to be produced by the code. 

"make clean" - Removes all the executable files from the directory.

NOTE: A small "_" is added at the end of each run command to differentiate it with the executable file names. Otherwise, makefile throws and error.
